description: Add file to all paths with a search result. In this example, we add an Apache license beside each README.md file.

# Find all repositories that contain a README.md file.
on:
  - repositoriesMatchingQuery: file:README.md count:200

# Besides each match, add a readme file. Note that repository.search_result_paths is a helper variable provided by the spec templating language.
steps:
  - run: |
        for result in ${{repository.search_result_paths}};
        do
            pushd "$(dirname "$result")"
            cat /tmp/apache.txt > LICENSE.md
            popd
        done

# We could have just added a single license at the root of each matching repository with
# cat /tmp/apache.txt > LICENSE.md
    container: ubuntu:18.04
    mount:
      # Note that this requires apache.txt to be available at the same level as the batch spec.
      # To execute on the server, use `src batch remote -f mount-file.batch.yaml`.
      - path: ./apache.txt
        mountpoint: /tmp/apache.txt

# Describe the changeset (e.g., GitHub pull request) you want for each repository.
