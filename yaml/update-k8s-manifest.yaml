description: |
  Add namespace and modify metadata annotations.

  This is an arbitrary script used to insert some made up values that Bolaji created into
  kubernetes spec files. 
  The script doesn't explicitly check which YAML is used by k8s because it assumes every YAML
  in the `sourcegraph-testing/k8s-examples` repo is a kubernetes spec file.

# Find the first 100 search results for README files.
# This could yield less than 100 repos/workspaces if some repos contain multiple READMEs.
